# State CDC Data Analysis

### Download Instructions:

1) Download all files with the last commit comment "TO UPLOAD" (data.js, maps.js, index.html).

2) Save files to the same folder (any folder, anywhere, as long as they are in the same folder). If you put any file into a separate folder, the html will not run.

3) Do not rename any of the files, or they will not run.

### Using the Site:

The top of the site includes a link to all of the raw data used to compile the table shown on the site. The next section is the data table, with the option to filter the data by state, year, and/or governor's political party. You can save the AVERAGES of this data in the "Data A/B/C/D" section just above the table, and you can take notes below each set of averages so you can remember what filters were applied to generate those numbers.
